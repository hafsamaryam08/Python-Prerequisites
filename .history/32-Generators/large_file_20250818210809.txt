Iterators

Iterators are advanced Python concepts that allow for efficient looping and memory management. 

Iterators provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying structure.

Generators

Generators are a simpler way to create iterators. 

They use the yield keyword to produce a series of values lazily, which means they generate values on the fly and do not store them in memory.
